# Python List Processing Error Handling
This example shows how to robustly handle potential errors (KeyError and TypeError) when processing a list of dictionaries in Python.  The `function_with_uncommon_error` is designed to gracefully handle cases where a dictionary might be missing the expected 'value' key, or where a non-dictionary object is present in the list.
